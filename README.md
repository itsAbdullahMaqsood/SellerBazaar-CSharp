## Overview

I am delighted to share my second-semester projectâ€”a sophisticated C# Winforms and SQL Server-based application. It is a *One-Stop Ecommerce Shopping Application* where sellers, buyers, and admin can select their role and login to start selling, buying, or managing the app respectively. This project serves as a testament to my proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming and database management, showcasing my capacity to design and implement comprehensive software solutions.

## Features

- ### Prompting The User to Select Role and Login:

  The moment the user starts the application, they are prompted to select their role in this application.
  
  - If they are a buyer, they select "**Buyer**" and login using their credentials that are already saved in the SQL Server as shown in the Demo.

- ### Don't Have an Account?

  If the user is using the application for the first time, they can Sign-Up and make a new account that will be saved in the SQL Server. Once the account is made, it can be used to Sign-In and start using the app.
